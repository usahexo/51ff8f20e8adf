#  Internet Casino Reports Record Earnings

Internet casinos have seen their earnings surge in recent years, with industry analysts predicting that the market will only continue to grow. The market is currently estimated to be worth over $30 billion, and is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2020. This steady growth is attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of online gambling and the expanding global population.

In particular, internet casinos have seen success in Asian markets. Macau, for instance, is now the world’s largest gambling market, with casino revenues reaching over $33 billion in 2017. This growth is largely due to the increasing wealth of East Asian consumers, who are increasingly able to afford luxury pursuits like gambling.

The US also remains a key market for internet casinos, with revenues reaching over $10 billion in 2017. This is largely due to the favourable regulatory environment in the US, which has allowed for the development of a robust online gambling industry. However, this growth could soon be threatened by new regulations proposed by the US Department of Justice.

Overall, internet casinos are forecasted to continue growing at a healthy rate in coming years. By 2020, it is estimated that they will account for nearly one-third of all global gambling revenues. This makes them an attractive investment opportunity for casino operators and investors alike.

#  Nevada Gambling Sites Reporting Increased Earnings

Nevada gambling sites are reporting increased earnings from online sports betting and casino games. Gaming officials say that the industry has seen a 6.5 percent increase in revenue since last year, with earnings totaling $1.35 billion.

The state’s largest gambling companies all saw increases in their online gaming revenue. MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts all reported double-digit gains.

This is good news for Nevada, which has been struggling to keep up with neighboring states like Oregon and California when it comes to gambling revenue. The state has been working to legalize internet poker and sports betting, and it seems that these efforts are starting to pay off.

Nevada legalized internet poker in 2013, but the industry has yet to really take off. This may be due to the fact that Nevada does not have a large population, so there are not as many potential players as there are in states like California.

Sports betting is a different story. The industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, thanks in part to the legalization of sports betting in a number of states. Nevada was one of the first states to legalize sports betting, and it has benefited accordingly.

Online casino games are also doing well in Nevada. The industry has been growing rapidly over the past few years, thanks in part to the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. This growth is likely to continue in the years ahead, as more people switch over to mobile devices for their gaming needs.

#  Delaware Online Casinos see $1M in Earnings

Delaware’s statewide regulated online casinos saw $1 million in earnings during the month of June, according to figures released by the Delaware Lottery on Wednesday.

This is the first time that earnings from the casinos have topped the million-dollar mark. Delaware launched its online casino industry in late 2013, becoming the first U.S. state to do so.

The earnings are a combined total from both of Delaware’s licensed casinos – Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Harrington Raceway & Casino. Dover Downs generated about $569,000 during the month of June, while Harrington brought in about $433,000.

These numbers come as welcome news for state officials, who have been looking for ways to bolster revenue following years of declining tax income. In 2017, Delaware brought in $381 million in total revenue – a 5 percent decrease from 2016 levels.

Governor John Carney has credited the growth of Delaware’s online casino industry with helping to mitigate some of these losses. In a statement released on Wednesday, Carney said that “the addition of online gaming has helped to grow our economy and create jobs in our state.”

The governor also highlighted the importance of reinvesting casino earnings back into state programs, which will be done through the recently-approved budget for FY2019. Some $2 million of the $1 million generated in June will be earmarked for this purpose.

#  Gibraltar Online Casino Revenue up 96%

Elsewhere in Gibraltar’s thriving online casino sector, giants such as 888 Holdings, bet365 and William Hill continue to prosper, while new entrants such as LeoVegas and Casumo are beginning to make their presence felt. With such a diverse and competitive market place, it is clear that Gibraltar remains the number one choice for online casino enthusiasts around the world.
