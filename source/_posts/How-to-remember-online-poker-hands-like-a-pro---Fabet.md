#  How to remember online poker hands like a pro - Fabet

There are a few ways that you can remember online poker hands - the first is by using a hand ranking chart, and the second is by using 'memory hooks'.

The first way to remember online poker hands is to use a hand ranking chart. This way of remembering will work for any type of poker game. All you need to do is memorize the rank of each hand, from highest to lowest. There are variations of this method, but the main idea is to remember the rank of each hand.

The second way to remember online poker hands is by using 'memory hooks'. This method involves creating images or stories in your head that will help you remember each individual hand. This type of memory technique is often used for items that need to be remembered in a specific order. For example, if you are learning the alphabet, you might create an image for each letter (a giant ape eating an apple for A, a baby swimming in a bathtub for B, etc). The key with this method is to make sure that the images are unique and easy to remember.

Here are a few tips on how to use these methods:

- When using a hand ranking chart, it's important to learn the order of the hands. In most cases, the Royal Flush is at the top of the list, followed by Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, etc.

- When using 'memory hooks', it's important to create unique images that stand out in your mind. You might want to come up with stories or jokes related to each image. Also, try to keep the images as simple as possible.

- Make sure you practice regularly! The more you practice these methods, the better you will become at remembering online poker hands.

#  How to never forget a poker hand again - with Fabet

There are a few tried and tested methods for avoiding the dreaded forgetful streak when it comes to poker hands - let's take a look at some of them.

1. Write it down

Simply writing down the hand can be a great way to remember it. It doesn't have to be anything too elaborate, just a basic sketch of the table and your cards will do. This is especially useful if you're playing more than one game simultaneously - you can refer back to your notes to check on what you've already played.

2. Use a Poker cheat sheet

If you're looking for something a little more comprehensive, using a poker cheat sheet is a great way to never forget a hand again. These sheets usually list all the possible hands in order from strongest to weakest, as well as what action you should take with each one. This can be really handy if you're still learning the game and want to make sure you don't make any rookie mistakes.

3. Use a poker tracker

If you tend to play online poker, using a poker tracker is an essential tool for ensuring you never forget a hand again. This software records all of the hands that are played in any given session, so you can refer back to them later and see what went wrong (or right!). This is an especially helpful tool for improving your game - by analysing your mistakes, you can work on fixing them and start winning more often.
