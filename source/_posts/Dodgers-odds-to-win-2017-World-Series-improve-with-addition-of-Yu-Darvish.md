#  Dodgers odds to win 2017 World Series improve with addition of Yu Darvish

The Los Angeles Dodgers have improved their odds to win the 2017 World Series with the addition of Yu Darvish. Darvish was acquired from the Texas Rangers in a trade deadline deal on Monday.

The Dodgers sent three prospects to the Rangers in return for Darvish, who is expected to join the team for Tuesday's game against the Atlanta Braves.

"We are obviously excited about it," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of the trade. "It's a huge addition for us."

Darvish will be a free agent after the season, and there had been speculation that he might not re-sign with Texas if they were unable to reach the postseason. The Rangers are currently in last place in the AL West with a 47-62 record.

The Dodgers, meanwhile, hold a 61-50 record and are in first place in the NL West. Adding Darvish gives them one of the best rotations in baseball, along with Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill, Alex Wood and Kenta Maeda.

"Yu is one of the best pitchers in baseball," Roberts said. "He's going to make our rotation even deeper and give us a chance to win every night."

Las Vegas odds makers have responded to the trade by increasing the Dodgers' odds of winning the World Series from 8-1 to 5-1. They are now second only to the Cleveland Indians, who are listed at 4-1.

The addition of Darvish is also good news for bettors. Anyone who wagered on the Dodgers at 8-1 prior to the trade now stands to make a significant profit if they win it all.

#  After blockbuster trade, Astros now clear favorites to win 2017 World Series

Houston Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow pulled off a blockbuster trade on Monday, shipping top pitching prospect Francis Martes and two other minor leaguers to the Miami Marlins for established ace pitchers Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander.

The move makes the Astros the clear favorites to win the 2017 World Series.

Verlander, a six-time All-Star and former Cy Young Award winner, gives Houston an imposing one-two punch at the top of its starting rotation. Cole, who is coming off a down year but still has upside, gives the Astros depth they lacked in their starting rotation.

Luhnow also bolstered Houston's bullpen on Monday by trading for hard-throwing reliever Joe Smith. With Chris Devenski, Luke Gregerson and Will Harris all returning from last year's World Series squad, the Astros have arguably the deepest bullpen in baseball.

Houston's offense is also reloaded with the addition of MVP candidate Jose Altuve and sluggers Carlos Correa and George Springer. Add in veteran catcher Brian McCann and super utility player Marwin Gonzalez, and the Astros have as complete of a team as any in baseball.

The Cleveland Indians and Los Angeles Dodgers are the only other teams that can rival Houston for supremacy in the American League. But neither of those teams has Verlander or Cole at the top of their pitching staffs like the Astros do.

As for the National League, it's hard to see anyone matching up with Houston in a seven-game series. The Washington Nationals did make some big moves this offseason (most notably acquiring Adam Eaton), but they still lack the star power of Houston's roster.

In short, the 2017 season is setting up to be a coronation for Jeff Luhnow and the Houston Astros.

#  Dodgers become instant contenders with addition of Yu Darvish

The Los Angeles Dodgers became instant contenders on Tuesday, when they acquired Yu Darvish from the Texas Rangers.

Darvish is one of the best pitchers in baseball, and he gives the Dodgers a formidable 1-2 punch at the top of their rotation alongside Clayton Kershaw.

This move also frees up Alex Wood to move back to the bullpen, where he will be an excellent reliever.

The Dodgers now have one of the best rotations in all of baseball, and they are poised to make a deep run into October.

#  With addition of Yu Darvish, Dodgers odds to make World Series slashed

The Los Angeles Dodgers started the offseason by acquiring arguably the best pitcher on the market in Yu Darvish. This was a clear message to the rest of the league that they are here to win it all in 2018. And the oddsmakers have taken notice, slashing the Dodgers odds to make the World Series from 9/2 to 6/1.

The addition of Darvish gives them one of the strongest rotations in baseball. Clayton Kershaw, Darvish, Rich Hill, Alex Wood, and Kenta Maeda is a daunting quintet for any team to face. With games against the Giants, Rockies, and Padres also on their schedule, they should be able to cruise to another NL West title.

In addition to their rotation, they also have one of the best lineups in baseball. Led by Corey Seager,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Justin Turner, and Cody Bellinger, they can beat you with power or with speed. They also have a deep bullpen led by Kenley Jansen.

It’s going to take a lot for anyone to knock off the Dodgers in 2018. They are clearly the team to beat in the National League.

#  Astros now heavy favorites to win World Series after acquiring Justin Verlander

Houston Astros acquired Justin Verlander from Detroit Tigers on Sunday, sending prospects Franklin Perez, Jake Rogers and Daz Cameron to Detroit. The move makes Houston heavy favorites to win the World Series.

Verlander is a former MVP and Cy Young Award winner. He will join a rotation that includes Dallas Keuchel and Lance McCullers Jr., giving the Astros one of the best rotations in baseball.

Houston (93-59) had already clinched the AL West division title and is now three games ahead of Cleveland for the best record in baseball. They will now have to wait until the end of the Detroit Tigers season to see if they receive any more prospects in return.

The Astros are currently +180 favorites to win the World Series, with the Cleveland Indians at +225.
