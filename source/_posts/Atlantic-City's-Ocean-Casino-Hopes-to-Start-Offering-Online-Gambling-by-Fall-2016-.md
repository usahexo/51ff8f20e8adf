#  Atlantic City's Ocean Casino Hopes to Start Offering Online Gambling by Fall 2016 

Atlantic City's Ocean Casino Resort is planning to start offering online gambling by fall of 2016. The casino is one of the first in the country to seek approval from the state Division of Gaming Enforcement to offer online gaming.

Upon receiving approval, the casino will offer a full suite of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. It will also offer two slots games: "Deal or No Deal" and "The Price is Right." The games will be available on desktop computers and mobile devices.

Ocean Casino Resort CEO Michael Donovan says that the online gaming market is growing rapidly and that the casino wants to be able to offer its customers a full range of gaming options. He also said that the casino plans to partner with an online gaming provider that has a good reputation and extensive experience in the industry.

The casino has already hired about 100 people who will be responsible for overseeing and managing the online gaming operation.

#  After delays, NJ's Ocean Casino set to offer online gambling in September 

After years of debate and delay, New Jersey's casino industry is finally ready to offer online gambling. Borgata, the state's top casino, announced Wednesday that it will offer online gambling in September, followed by Ocean Casino Resort in early October.

The rollout has been a long time coming. Online gambling was legalized in New Jersey in 2013, but regulatory hurdles and disagreements among casino operators prevented any sites from going live. In May, the state finally reached an agreement with the casinos on regulations, paving the way for Wednesday's announcements.

It's not clear yet exactly when all of New Jersey's casinos will offer online gambling. But it appears that most of them are preparing to do so in the coming weeks.

"Online gaming is coming to New Jersey," said Jim Ryan, CEO of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company. "We're excited to deliver our world-class online experiences to New Jersey players."

Online gambling offers a host of potential benefits for the casinos and for New Jersey as a whole. It could help boost Atlantic City's flagging fortunes by bringing in new players and revenue. And it could help the state generate much-needed tax revenue.

New Jersey is one of only a handful of states that have legalized online gambling. The others are Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia.

#  Atlantic City's Ocean Casino to offer online gambling in November 

Atlantic City's Ocean Casino will soon offer online gambling to its patrons, in addition to the traditional casino gaming offered on premises. The addition of online gambling is expected to bolster the casino's revenues, which have been in decline in recent years.

The new online gambling system will go live in November and will be available to anyone over the age of 21 who is within the state of New Jersey. Atlantic City's Ocean Casino is one of three casinos in New Jersey that will offer online gambling, joining Borgata and Golden Nugget.

Patrons at Atlantic City's Ocean Casino will be able to gamble on casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots, as well as participate in poker tournaments. All of the games offered will be through the casino's website and not through any third-party providers.

Atlantic City's Ocean Casino has been struggling in recent years, with revenues declining by more than $100 million since 2014. The addition of online gambling is seen as a way to help revive the casino's fortunes. In fact, analysts believe that online gambling could add as much as $200 million to Atlantic City's annual gaming revenue.

With brick-and-mortar casinos facing increasing competition from casinos in other states, as well as from ever-growing popularity of internet betting, it has become increasingly important for casinos to offer a variety of gaming options. Atlantic City's Ocean Casino seems to realize this and is making moves to stay competitive.

#  Ocean Casino Resort to offer online gambling in December

 ## Atlantic City, NJ

Ocean Casino Resort announced last week that they will be rolling out their online gambling platform in December. The new platform, which is being built in partnership with NYX Gaming Group, will offer a range of casino games, including slots, blackjack and roulette.

The resort is hoping that the online gambling offering will help to attract more visitors to the property. In a statement announcing the launch, Ocean Casino Resort CEO Michael Marino said: "This venture positions Ocean Casino Resort at the forefront of New Jersey's gaming industry by providing our customers with innovative technology and a first-class experience."

The online gambling market in New Jersey has been growing rapidly in recent years. In 2017, revenue from online gaming totaled $260 million, representing a 21% increase from the previous year. It is expected that the market will continue to grow in 2019, with revenue predicted to reach $311 million.

Ocean Casino Resort is not the only casino in Atlantic City to offer online gambling. Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and Caesars Atlantic City both launched online platforms earlier this year. However, Ocean Casino Resort is the only casino in Atlantic City to offer sports betting. The resort already has an agreement in place with William Hill US to provide sports betting services when it goes live later this year.

Ocean Casino Resort is expecting big things from its online gambling offering. In a statement, Marino said: "This venture positions Ocean Casino Resort at the forefront of New Jersey's gaming industry by providing our customers with innovative technology and a first-class experience."

#  January 2017: Ocean Casino Becomes Latest New Jersey Venue to Offer Online Gambling

The Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has announced that it will offer online gambling from January 24th, becoming the latest venue in the state to do so.

The casino is following in the footsteps of other Atlantic City venues such as Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, and Resorts Casino Hotel, all of which have been offering online gambling since November 2013.

Atlantic City is one of three states in the US that currently offer legal online gambling (the others being Nevada and Delaware). In order to partake in online gambling within these states, players must be physically located within their borders.

Given that New Jersey is home to more than 9 million residents, it’s no surprise that the state’s online gambling industry is doing well; in fact, research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC estimates that by 2020 New Jersey’s online gambling market will be worth $715 million.

What’s more, not only does Atlantic City offer a wealth of land-based casinos for players to choose from, but there are also many quality online casinos that accept NJ players. So whether you enjoy spinning the reels on slot machines or playing blackjack and roulette at a live dealer table, there’s something for everyone in New Jersey’s thriving online gambling market.
