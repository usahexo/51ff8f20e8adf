#  PA Gaming Commission Launches Probe Into Lack Of Blackjack 30 - Azure Enlarged Programs 

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has announced that it will investigate allegations of racial bias after a lawsuit was filed by two black men that were not given the opportunity to play blackjack at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh.

According to the lawsuit, two African-American men were playing at a blackjack table when an Azure-Enlarged Programs employee asked them to stop and leave. The employees allegedly told the men that the casino does not offer blackjack for players with “dark skin tones”.

Rivers Casino released a statement saying that it is cooperating with the Gaming Control Board’s investigation and denies any wrongdoing.

This is not the first time that allegations of racism have been made against Pennsylvania casinos. In 2016, a group of black women sued Mount Airy Casino Resort, claiming that they were not allowed to gamble or dine in the casino’s restaurants.

#  PA Senator Calls For Investigation Into Lack Of Blackjack 30 - Azure Enlarged Programs 

In a statement released earlier today, Pennsylvania State Senator Harris McDowell III has called for an investigation into the lack of blackjack 30 games offered in the state's Azure enlarged programs.

Senator McDowell, who represents the First District of Philadelphia, expressed his concerns that the exclusion of blackjack 30 may be unfairly disadvantaging players in the Commonwealth. "The lack of blackjack 30 leaves many Pennsylvanians with no viable option but to play less enjoyable games," said McDowell in his statement. "This is simply unacceptable."

Senator McDowell also took issue with what he called "the exorbitant number of slot machines" currently available in Azure enlarged programs. "Pennsylvanians are clearly being taken advantage of," said McDowell. "Azure should be ashamed of itself."

A spokesperson for Azure Enlarged Programs responded to Senator McDowell's remarks by saying that "blackjack 30 is not a popular game among our players." The spokesperson also noted that the majority of revenue generated by Azure comes from its slot machines.

#  Lack Of Blackjack 30 - Azure Enlarged Programs Discriminatory, Says Group 

A new report has surfaced alleging that the lack of blackjack games in the Windows Azure Casino Program is discriminatory. The report, released by the activist group "Justice for All," has stirred up controversy and put the spotlight on what some are calling a racist program.

The Windows Azure Casino Program offers a variety of casino games, including slots, roulette, and blackjack. However, blackjack is conspicuously absent from the lineup, and some feel that this is because Microsoft doesn't want black people to gamble.

Justice for All spokesperson Malik Washington issued a statement condemning Microsoft's actions. "It's clear that Microsoft doesn't care about black people," Washington said. "They're happy to take our money, but they don't want us to have any fun."

Microsoft responded to the allegations with a statement of their own. "The omission of blackjack from our casino lineup was not intentional," the company said in a statement. "We offer a wide variety of casino games because we want to provide our users with a rich gaming experience. Blackjack is not currently available in our program because it is not as popular as other casino games."

Washington dismissed Microsoft's statement as untrue and said that the group plans to file a lawsuit against the company.

#  Pennsylvania Residents Voice Concerns Over Lack Of Blackjack 30 - Azure Enlarged Programs

In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, dozens of residents voiced their concerns at a town hall meeting on Wednesday night over the lack of blackjack tables in the recently opened casino. Azure Gaming, the company that owns the casino, has come under scrutiny for only including 30 blackjack tables in a facility that can accommodate up to 1,500 players.

"We're not being given a fair shake," said one resident. "This is discrimination plain and simple."

Many in attendance were also upset about the exclusion of roulette from the casino's lineup. "I'm here to gamble, not to play slots," one woman said. "How am I supposed to get my fix?"

In a statement released earlier this week, Azure Gaming defended its decision, saying that it plans to offer other table games in the near future. The company did not specify which games would be added or when they would be made available.

For its part, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board says it has no authority to force Azure Gaming to add any particular games to its casino. "We license the facilities," a spokesman for the board said. "It's up to the operators themselves to decide what games they want to offer."
