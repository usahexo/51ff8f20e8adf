Created by Damon, moobot roulette Bingo is a game that is played with a regular deck of playing cards. The basic premise is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over, using any combination of 3 cards. Aces are 1 point, 2s through 10s are face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are all worth 10 points.

If you are dealt two cards of the same rank (e.g. two Queens), this is called a ‘pair’. If you are dealt three of the same rank, this is called a ‘triple’. A ‘moobot’ is when you have one card of each rank (e.g. Ace, 2, 3).

To start the game, each player places an equal bet on the layout. The dealer then deals out two cards face down to each player and two cards face up in the middle of the layout – these are called the ‘flop’. The players then look at their cards and decide whether to place another bet (known as a ‘raise’), fold their hand or stay in the game by making a Play bet that is equal to the amount of their original bet.

If one or more players stays in the game, the dealer flips over the next card – this is called the ‘turn’ card. If this card helps any of the players improve their hand (e.g. if it is an Ace and they already have an Ace), they can ask for another card by placing an ‘insurance’ bet that is twice the size of their original bet; if not, they must either keep their hand as it is or fold.

The dealer then flips over the last card – this is called the ‘river’ card – and players with winning hands collect their winnings from those who didn’t make better hands than them. The following payout schedule applies:

– One pair: 1-1
– Two pairs: 2-1
– Three of a kind: 3-1
– Straight: 5-1 
– Flush: 7-1 
– Full house: 9-1 
– Four of a kind: 25-1 
– Straight flush: 50-1 
– Royal flush: 100-1
