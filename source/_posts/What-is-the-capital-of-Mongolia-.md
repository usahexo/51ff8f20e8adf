#  What is the GDP of Mongolia? 

The GDP of Mongolia is $11.465 billion as of 2018 according to The World Bank. This puts it at 95th in the world for GDP. 

Mongolia has seen its GDP grow significantly in recent years, with a 7.3% growth in 2017 and 11.7% growth in 2016. This is due in part to the increasing population's demand for goods and services, as well as the country's ongoing efforts to diversify its economy. 

The major components of Mongolia's economy are mining (copper, gold, coal, and other minerals), livestock, tourism, and manufacturing. Over 60% of the population is employed in the livestock sector, making it an important driver of economic growth. 

Mongolia faces a few significant challenges going forward. One is its large budget deficit, which has been exacerbated by the government's recent stimulus efforts. Another challenge is its dependence on China as an export market. Any slowdown in the Chinese economy could have a negative impact on Mongolia's growth prospects.
