#  Which In Turn Slot Machine Vegas Words Pays Off Most

If you want to make some real money when playing the slots in Las Vegas, it's important to pick the right games. Some machines payout more often than others, so it's worth your time to do a bit of research before deciding which games to play.

One game that is particularly lucrative is "Which In Turn". This slot machine offers some of the best payouts in all of Vegas, with an average return to player (RTP) of 97.5%. In other words, for every $100 put in, players can expect to get back almost $98 on average.

The game works like this: players are given three options, and they must choose one before the next reel spins. If the player selects the right option, they'll win a payout equivalent to their original bet multiplied by a random number from 1-10. So, if you bet $10 and select the right option, you'll win $100.

There's no guarantee that you'll win on any given spin, but with an RTP of nearly 98%, you're far more likely to come out ahead playing "Which In Turn" than with most other slot machines in Vegas. Give it a try next time you're in Sin City!
