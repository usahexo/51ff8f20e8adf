The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible. You can either draw cards until you reach 21 or stop at any point before that and hope the dealer goes bust. If your hand total is higher than the dealer’s, you win; if it’s lower, you lose.

## The basics of blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played against the dealer. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a "blackjack"), or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21.

To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards face up. The player then decides whether to "stand" (play with the two cards they have been dealt) or to "hit" (take another card). When you hit, you are then given another card; if this takes your total over 21 then you bust and lose the hand. The dealer also draws cards until they reach 17 points; at which point they must "stand".

The player's goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The ace can be counted as 1 or 11 points, and other cards are face value. So, for example, if you are dealt an 8 and a 3, your total would be 11 points (8 + 3 = 11).

If both the player and dealer have busted (havecards totalling over 21), then the player automatically wins. If neither side has busted but the player's hand is stronger than that of the dealer, then the player wins too. In all other cases, the hand is a tie and no money changes hands.

In casinos in Lichtenstein there are usually six decks of cards used in blackjack games. In order to improve your chances of winning, it is important to understand some basic strategy for playing blackjack. We will discuss this in more detail later on in this article.

## Playing blackjack in Lichtenstein casinos

There are many casinos in Lichtenstein where you can play blackjack; some of the most popular ones include Casino Kleinwalsertal, Casino Schaanwald and Casino Triesen. Most casinos offer both American and European versions of blackjack; so if you're not sure which one to choose, ask one of the dealers for advice.

Casinos in Lichtenstein usually charge a modest fee for playing blackjack - typically around 2-3 euros per hand. In addition, there is usually a minimum bet amount required - often around 5 euros. However, there may be variations between different casinos so it's always worth checking beforehand. It's also worth bearing in mind that table limits increase with higher denomination games; so if you're looking to bet big money, it's worth playing at tables with higher maximums bets.


When choosing a table to play at, bear in mind that tables with lower minimum bets tend to be busier than those with high minimums - so you may have less opportunity to make moves during gameplay if you choose a busy table. Conversely, tables with high maximum bets tend to have fewer players and offer better odds - but obviously come with a bigger price tag attached!
