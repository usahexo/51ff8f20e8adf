#  Baltimore Approves Casino Gambling After Decades of Debate

The city of Baltimore, Maryland has greenlit casino gambling after more than two decades of contentious debate. The bill, which was passed on Monday, November 19th, will allow for up to five casino resorts in the city.

 Proponents of the bill argue that it will help to revive Baltimore's struggling economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating much-needed tax revenue. Critics say that the negative social effects of gambling addiction will outweigh any benefits.

Baltimore has been without casino gambling since 1992, when a statewide referendum banned it. That ban was overturned in October by a state commission that voted unanimously to permit casinos in certain jurisdictions, including Baltimore.

The City Council voted 11-2 in favor of the bill, with one abstention. Councilman John Bullock, who voted against the measure, said he was concerned about the social impacts of gambling addiction. "I don't think we did enough legwork," he said.

Mayor Catherine Pugh has expressed her support for the bill, saying that it will create jobs and economic opportunity in Baltimore. "It is going to be a catalyst for job creation and new development," she said.

The first of Baltimore's new casinos is expected to open in 2020.

#  Maryland's Largest City Endorses Slot Machines, Roulette

ANNAPOLIS, Md. - Yesterday, the Mayor and City Council of Maryland's largest city voted unanimously to endorse slot machines and roulette at the city's two casinos. The vote comes as the city faces significant financial challenges, with a budget shortfall of $30 million in fiscal year 2019.

"This was a difficult decision, but it is one that is necessary to help address our budget challenges," said Mayor Randall Johnson. "The revenue from slots and roulette will help us maintain essential services for our residents."

Opposition to the measure was vocal, but ultimately unsuccessful. "It's disgraceful that our city is endorsing gambling," said Rev. Kevin Brooks of St. Andrews United Methodist Church. "It will only lead to more addiction and poverty."

City officials defended the decision, saying that it would bring much-needed revenue to the city. "The casino operators have committed to invest millions of dollars in the City, creating new jobs and improving our infrastructure," said City Councilman John Smith. "This is a great deal for Annapolis."

Gambling has long been controversial in Maryland, with proponents arguing that it is a way to raise revenue for the state and opponents arguing that it leads to addiction and social ills. The issue is likely to be a central topic in next year's gubernatorial race.

#  Baltimore Joins Other Casino-Friendly Cities in the State

Baltimore is the latest city in Maryland to join the growing list of jurisdictions that are conducive to casino gaming. A bill proposing a referendum for a new casino in Baltimore was unanimously approved by the state Senate on Wednesday, February 7th.

If passed, the referendum would allow a developer to build a $500 million casino and entertainment complex near M&T Bank Stadium, home of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens. The new venue would create thousands of jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state annually.

The vote follows on the heels of approval by voters in November 2017 for a MGM resort casino in Prince George’s County, just outside of Washington D.C. In addition, a casino opened last year in Cecil County and another is being planned for southern Maryland.

Elected officials and business leaders in Baltimore have been pushing for a casino there for years, contending that it would help revive a struggling economy and create much-needed jobs. The proposal now goes to the House of Delegates, where it is also expected to pass. If so, voters will decide its fate in November.

Supporters say the new casino would bring much-needed revenue to Baltimore, which has been struggling economically in recent years. They also note that it would create thousands of jobs – 4,000 direct jobs and another 8,000 indirect jobs – as well as generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state every year.

Opponents say that casinos prey on people with gambling addictions and lead to increased crime and social ills. They also argue that the money generated by casinos could be better used for other purposes such as education or infrastructure improvements.

#  Charm City Says Yes to Gambling Expansion

In a city that's home to some of the country's most popular casinos, the news that Charm City will be expanding gambling came as no surprise to many. The move is seen as a way to help bolster the city's flagging economy and bring in much-needed revenue.

Supporters of the expansion say that it will create jobs and attract new businesses to the city. They also argue that it will help keep money in Baltimore that would otherwise be spent elsewhere.

Detractors, however, worry that the expansion will lead to an increase in crime and social problems. They also point out that the promised economic benefits have yet to materialize in other cities where gambling has been legalized.

Regardless of which side people are on, there's no doubt that this is a contentious issue. Many residents are anxious about how gambling will impact their neighborhoods and what kind of social costs it might bring with it.

Only time will tell if this gamble pays off for Baltimore or not.

#  Baltimore is latest Maryland city to OK casino gambling

After a lengthy debate, the Baltimore City Council voted Monday to allow table games and slot machines at the city’s two casinos, becoming the latest jurisdiction in Maryland to legalize some form of casino gambling.

The council’s 12-2 vote means that Baltimore joins most of the state’s other major population centers in allowing some form of casino gambling. The move is likely to bring increased competition for the state’s five existing casinos, as well as for its three racetracks with slots.

The bill’s sponsor, Councilman William H. “Pete” Welch, said he would have preferred a different approach that would have allowed table games but banned slots, but he supported the measure because it will create jobs and produce revenue for the city.

Opponents argued that the city was giving up too much in potential revenue and that gambling is a leading contributor to poverty. But supporters said that many people in the city are already gambling illegally and that legalizing casino gambling would bring regulation and jobs to Baltimore.

Both of the city’s casinos — Maryland Live! Casino in Anne Arundel County and Rocky Gap Casino Resort near Cumberland — are expected to begin offering table games and slots under the new law.
